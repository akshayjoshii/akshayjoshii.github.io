abstract: The artistic style of a painting is a rich descriptor that catches both visual and chronicled data about artistic creation. Accurately distinguishing the artistic style of paintings is significant for indexing large artistic databases. Artistic feature classification has received little to no attention in computer vision research. In this paper, we investigate the use of self-supervised learning methods to solve the problem of recognizing complex artistic styles and outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches by achieving an overall accuracy gain of 20% on a highly class imbalanced WikiArt dataset consisting of 27 classes.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Investigation on the use of deep semi-supervised neural models to extract dense features in complex & ambiguous images spanning across 27 unique artistic styles. Self-supervision enforced to resolve class imbalance of WikiArt dataset.
